                <p>When I was younger I came up with a recipe for 'popcorn soup' that was microwave popcorn dumped into a bowl of chicken broth. My parents humored me as I pretended to be a chef and brought it out to them at dinner. Turns out my career as a chef was short lived, but I got really into arts administration and web development. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mallorycoppenrath" target="_blank">Here's</a> my LinkedIn if you'd like to learn a little more about my work experience.</p>
